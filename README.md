# Windows_Manipulation
This repo was created whilst having to find ways to manipulate ancient Windows applications in closed network environments where modern high level languages were off the table.

For example, imagine not only not having an API (Let alone not being able to build one with Postman since the app isn't Web based), but not being able to use modern 
languages with their rich libraries like Python, Node JS, Go, etc.
